    the following project is a discussion of Palestine and its representation in western media. 
    with the current bombings and ethnic cleansing, the Palestinian people have faced hardships beyond words. this project 
    is an archive of Palestinian coverage from the ground in comparison to that of western media, which downplays and does not recognize the ethnic cleansing of Palestine.

    creatively, this project will include elements representative of the palestinian beauty through ASCII art. critically, this archive is a 
    commentary on the politicized nature of Palestine when the current state of israel has time and time again violated human rights and 
    international laws. [adding more capital imperialism]

            <p><pre>    
    western media has the tendency to describe the genocide of Palestinians without emphasizing the state of Israel.
    
    "Moms in Gaza struggle with adequate care" only because Israel has <em>denied</em> Palestine said adequate care.
    
    Gaza is not starving. Israel is starving Gaza.
    
    When the IDF discusses that Israel as a country has been hurt, yet the buildings in Israel are intact. The same 
    can <em>not</em> be said about Palestinian territories.
