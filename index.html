            <h2>project overview/introduction</h2>

            <p>
    the following project is a discussion of Palestine and its representation in western media. with the current bombings and ethnic cleansing, 
    the Palestinian people have faced hardships beyond words. this project is an archive of Palestinian coverage from the ground in comparison 
    to that of western media, which downplays and does not recognize the ethnic cleansing of Palestine.</p>

            <p>
    creatively, this project will include elements representative of the palestinian beauty through ASCII art. critically, this archive is a 
    commentary on the politicized nature of Palestine when the current state of israel has time and time again violated human rights and 
    international laws.

            <h2>western media/institutional <em>"acknowledgement"</em></h2>

            <p>  
    western media has the tendency to describe the genocide of Palestinians without emphasizing the state of israel. "moms in Gaza struggle 
    with adequate care" only because israel has <em>denied</em> Palestine said adequate care. Gaza is not starving. israel is starving Gaza. the 
    idf describes israel as a country that has been hurt, yet the buildings in israel are intact. the same can <em>not</em> be said about Palestinian 
    territories. on instagram, israeli people most pictures to captions of "war days" while their roofs are intact, and they have food, water, and electricity
    while those in Gaza are starving to death, losing those around them day after day. they do not have roofs over their heads, are living outside in 
    tents (if they are lucky) in the freezing cold season- constantly fearing for their lives and well being.

            <h3>the following is an email sent out to the sjsu campus community with the headline "the continuing crisis in the middle east".</h3>

            <p>
    DEC. 21, 2023 01:32PM<br><br>
    
    Dear campus community,<br><br>

    As our campus quiets for the winter break, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge the unique challenges we have faced over the past few months 
    and the profound impact they’ve had on so many.
                    
    The humanitarian crisis continues in Gaza. We have spent significant time listening to students, staff, and faculty about how they are impacted by 
    what they have heard, seen, and are learning. The images coming from the region and the news about the rising deaths and continuing violence are 
    devastating, and the grief, fears, anxiety, and anger are clearly impacting our SJSU community. We have experienced immense pressure to denounce 
    terrorism, violence, and genocide and for the university to take a stance in the war in Gaza. As we work to meet our collective obligations to care 
    for the wider campus community, we acknowledge that any statement we make as an institution will never be enough to adequately address the deep pain 
    being felt among the communities most impacted on campus.
                    
    The Chancellor’s Office recently sent a letter to all CSU campuses condemning Islamophobia and antisemitism, sentiments we support wholeheartedly. 
    But at this fragile moment, we must say even more. In light of increasing reports of anti-Muslim racism and Islamophobia across the country, including 
    the targeted shooting of three Palestinian students in Vermont, we need to reiterate that reports of the targeting of individuals, specifically 
    pro-Palestinian, will be thoroughly investigated and addressed. It is the essence of Islamophobia to assume that all people who support Palestinians 
    are Muslim or even that all Palestinians are Islamic. In fact, there are many Jewish supporters of Palestine who have both experienced the deep pain 
    of seeing the violence perpetrated by Hamas in Israel and continue to advocate for Palestinians and are asking for an end to the conflict. Further, 
    not all who identify as Jewish are religious, nor are aligned with the policies of the current leadership of the state of Israel. To make such sweeping 
    generalizations about Jewish people is to perpetuate antisemitic rhetoric. We enjoy the ability to critique the leadership and policies in the USA, and 
    we can similarly do the same with Israeli leadership and policies without relying on racist antisemitic tropes.
                                    
    We have consistently focused on the well-being of this campus and our ability to grapple with issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We have paid 
    attention to the rise in Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) cases for students seeking mental health support since Israel was brutally 
    attacked on October 7 and the increase of reported cases of Islamophobia and anti-semitism, feelings of fearfulness to share pro-Palestinian 
    perspectives or to condemn Hamas in classrooms, and confrontations in virtual spaces among other realities of what feels like an increasingly polarized 
    and divided campus community. This greatly concerns us because our priority has been, and always will be, to maintain a strong sense of well-being, 
    belonging, and community that make us proud to be Spartans. 
                                    
    We have taken diligent actions to maintain a community where all Spartans are able to participate and express their perspectives in university programs 
    and activities without fear of harassment and retaliation. Last Friday, the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI), with our Intergroup 
    Dialogue (IGD)-trained facilitators, held space for 32 staff and faculty Spartans to come together and begin talking about how the war has impacted them. 
    This session was full of emotions, learning, and courage, and is part of a broader effort to support the conversations that we know need to happen. The 
    insights we have gained through our many conversations are helping us to direct resources to best meet needs and we will continue to connect our campus 
    community to resources. 
                    
    We are keenly aware the vocabulary we use to talk about what is going on must strike a balance to acknowledge anti-Muslim racism and Islamophobia, 
    antisemitism, racism and sexism, colonialism and oppression. To name some without others would be turning our backs on our institutional values and 
    educational mission as a teaching, research, and service-oriented institution. Perhaps harder still, while the pain runs so deep, we must be able to be 
    in conversation with one another, to sit in discomfort, to be challenged, to see each other’s hurt and injury, and not be consumed by dogma that 
    prevents compassion, empathy, and understanding.  We must apply these principles not just to the current conflict in the Middle East but to ongoing 
    conflicts across the globe, all of which also touch members of our Spartan community. 
                    
    As we close out this semester and celebrate our graduates, may we all remember that SJSU is a place where dialogue and inquiry is continuously fostered. 
    Let us all keep a strong sense of well-being, belonging, and community so we can all continue to grow together. 
    <br><br>                                
    Sincerely, 
    <br><br>
