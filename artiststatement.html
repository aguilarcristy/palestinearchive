    The following project is a discussion of Palestine and its representation in Western media. 
    With the current bombings and ethnic cleansing taking place, the Palestinian people have faced hardships beyond words. This project is an archive of 
    Palestinian coverage from the ground in comparison to that of Western media, which downplays and does not acknowledge the severity of the current environment 
    Palestinians are facing. This is by no means a complete list of all the articles that downplay what is occurring in Palestine or a complete list of the countless 
    journalists who have risked and continue to do so in order to show the world the truth and reality of what is occurring in Gaza. What is occurring now in Palestine,
    started over 70 years ago, is an important issue we must address, understand, and speak out for.<br><br>
           
Creatively, this project will include elements representative of the Palestinian beauty and culture through ASCII art. 
Critically, this archive is a commentary on the politicized nature of Palestine and the bias and omission of Western media coverage. 
The apartheid state of Israel has time and time again violated human rights and international laws, especially within the last 4 months. 
This is not a matter of politics, but of how zionism, racism, islamaphobia, imperialism, and capitalism allow for the complacency and silence in regards to the 
ongoing genocide and ethnic of the Palestinian people.
<br><br>
The archive includes examples of news articles and social media post that donâ€™t acknowledge the atrocities occuring in Palestine, an email statement sent to the SJSU community in regards to what is cocuring in Palestine (similar to letters from elected officials, they have no true substance and fail to recognize the humanity, innocence, and right of existence of Palestinian people), Palestinian journalists who have covered the genocide on the ground, and a short list of resources to help the people of Palestine.
